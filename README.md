## Description

`AvatarImageView` is a customisable subclass of UIImageView that is designed to show users' profile pictures. It falls back to the user's initials with a random background color if no image is specified.

This library was inspired by and is supposed to be a Swift rewrite of [bachonk/UIImageView-Letters](https://github.com/bachonk/UIImageView-Letters). 

THIS LIBRARY IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
